1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive layouts are basically fixed layouts with media queries to accommodate certain break points (limited number of devices). Adaptive layouts make use of hard coded values.
Fully responsive websites use %s to accommodate many devices.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

	Mobile first means designing a site for mobile use initially then moving on to bigger resolution devices (desktops). Mobile first utilizes min-width compared to max-width utilized by desktops first.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

	The 62.5% font-size gives us a pixel to rem ratio of 1:10. Basically saying rem can be thought of as pixels but in base 10. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

	Preprocessing is a way to abstract certain css functionality and make it easier and more comprehensive to code.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

	My favorite concept in preprocessing would have to be parametric mixins because they make repetitive tasks easier. My least favorite would be functions because it means there’s a whole subsection of useful tools I can code with that I still don’t know about!
